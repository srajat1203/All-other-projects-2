/*Answers to questions
 * 1) The range is from 0 to 4
 * 2) No, it is not picking from  3 to 5. Range is from 3 to 7
 * 3) A random number is not being generated. All random numbers stay the same in each iteration
 * 4) A different random no is generated. However, the random numbers remain the same in each iteration
 * 5) (Deleted seed)
